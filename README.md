# Smartbrain App Backend Project

Smartbrain project on the Backend is build with Express.js, Node.js and Postgres Database, using Clarifai API to connect to the React Frontend project.
Despite being a full stack app I let this time the frontend separate from the backend to learn how CORS setting work and also manage crossite cookie and session in RL situation. We can login with a database using autorization, or login with google Oauth2.0 using authentification.
